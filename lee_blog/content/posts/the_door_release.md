## The Door

The circumstances of Justin's life have changed. Moving to the country has proved more peaceful than he had wanted and he misses the clubs, parties, friends and play dates he left behind in the city. Then one fateful day a walk in the woods presents an arousing surprise that might put him back on track for more excitement than he can handle.
