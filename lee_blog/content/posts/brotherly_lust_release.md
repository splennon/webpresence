## Brotherly Lust

Milo owes a debt of gratitude to his father for making him the man he is today. Now, twenty years later Milo has discovered that his own boys Tyler and Mike need some help growing into manhood. Reviving the traditions that Milo benefited from as a boy and enlisting help from an old acquaintance and a new friend Milo and his boys begin an adventure in discipline and chastity, but will Milo get more than he bargains for?
