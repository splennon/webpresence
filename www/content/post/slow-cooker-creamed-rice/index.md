A delicious and economical dish of creamed rice you can make easily in your slow cooker.2 litres of milk 225 g long grain rice 20 g of Splenda (About 5 tablespoons) 30 g butter 1/2 teaspoon of Allspice and Cinnamon 2 tablespoons of vanilla essence 2 eggs

Mix all ingredients except the eggs together in a slow cooker (3.5 litre cooker or bigger is recommended.)

Cover and cook on high for 3 hours.

Remove about 5 tablespoons of the mixture and allow it to cool in a bowl. Once it is not hotter than lukewarm, beat in the eggs and then mix well back into the batch. Now remove the lid and continue to cook on high until the correct consistancy is reached. This will take 20 or 30 minutes. Serve immediately or cool and refrigerate.

As this is a big batch, you can vacuum seal and sterilise it if you desire instead of cooling it. While still hot, place in a sous vide bag and pasteurise at 83 celsius for 30 minutes. Refrigerate or freeze thereafter.
