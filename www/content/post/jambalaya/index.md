Delicious jambalaya with chorizo and prawn.200 g large prawns 200 g smoked sausage: Andouille, Chorizo or similar 500 g chicken breast 160 g octopus (Sliced octopus is commonly available in Oriental food shops) 1 tin of chopped tomatoes 200 ml chicken stock made with one cube 1 medium onion 3 stalks of celery 1 bell pepper 1 bulb of garlic 250 g long grain rice 1 tablespoon of Cajun spice mix 1 teaspoon of oregano 1 teaspoon thyme 1 teaspoon crushed dried chillies 2 teaspoons smoked paprika (Particularly important if your chosen sausage does not have a strong smokey flavour)

This recipe fills a 3.5 litre slow cooker. Slice the sausage into rings not more than a quarter inch thick, but thicker than would be used on pizza for example. Cube the chicken. Cut the octopus into strips if it is not already.

Cut the onion, celery and bell pepper medium fine, and the garlic fine. If you wish to reduce cooking time you can soften the onion in the pan as in the slow cooker it will stay crispy for quite some time. This is not required for an extended cook.

Mix all the ingredients together in a slow cooker and pat the ingredients below the fluid level with a spoon if possible. Cover with the lid which must fit well as this is a relatively dry dish. Cook on high for 2 hours or until bubbles rise at the sides then reduce to medium for another 3 hours. At this point the dish will be good to eat but the onion may still be crunchy and a two hour spell on low will help the flavours develop more. Take the lid off for the last 30 minutes. Alternatively you can heat on high for an hour and then leave on low for 10 - 12 hours.

Allow to cool a little and serve.
