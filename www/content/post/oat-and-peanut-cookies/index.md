These are delicious, can be made gluten free, and are a good option for low-junk and restricted carb diets.

100 g Oat Flour 1 tbsp Oats 1 tbsp Oat Bran 150 g Ground Almonds 1 tsp Cinnamon 1 tsp Nutmeg 100 g Butter 2 tbsp smooth peanut butter 2 eggs 2-4 tbsp Sucralose 5 g Baking Powder (A little under 1 tsp)

Variations: Add Raisins or 70 g Chocolate Protein Powder or 50 g Cocoa or Natural Vanilla Essence

Mix the dry ingredients (Oat Flour, Bran and Oats, Ground Almonds, Spices, Peanut Butter, dry Sweetner and Baking Powder) in a large bowl.

Melt the butter but don't heat it too much and whisk it with the whole eggs and any wet ingredients you choose to add.

Combine all ingredients and stir to make a batter. Roll into large golf balls then press flat onto a teflon, silicone or paper baking sheet. The high butter content of these cookies will prevent sticking even to paper. This quantity of batter makes about 12 cookies.

Oven cook in a preheated oven at 180 C for upto 15 minutes but do not let the top of the cookies turn very brown. It may be helpful, even in a fan oven to rotate the tray half way through.

Allow to cool then store airtight or enjoy warm.
