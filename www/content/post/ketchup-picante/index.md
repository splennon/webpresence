This delicious, healthy homemade ketchup has a spicy kick of jalapeños.

400 g tinned chopped tomatos 200 g tube tomato purée 50 g raisins 1 teaspoon sea salt 100 g Apple Cider Vinegar 2 cloves garlic 1 teaspoon English Mustard 1 tablespoon of brown sugar 2 teaspoon medium curry powder 1 teaspoon cloves 1 teaspoon Chilli Flakes 50 g jalapeños

This is a variation on Ketchup that has a pleasant piquance. You can double the Jalapeños for a much spicier experience. The spices should be kept simple to allow the Jalapeños to shine through without complication. Apple Cider Vinegar promotes a softer round sweetness than other vinegars.

Add all ingredients to a heavy pan and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes or until approximately the thickness of mass produced ketchup. The ketchup will thicken a little more when cooled.

Purée with a stick blender until the raisins are no longer visible and to the desired consistency.

You may use the product once cool, but if you wish to extend shelf life to 3 months (1 year frozen) then, while still hot, place in a sous vide bag and pasteurise at 83 celsius for 30 minutes. Refrigerate or freeze unopened thereafter.
