This ginger tea is a delicious and healthy cleansing drink that doesn't taste healthy. You can make it directly in a flask as long as it has a strainer for later.

## Equipment

750 ml Thermos flask Strainer Weighing scales

## Ingredients

30 g ginger 40 g maple syrup 30 g lemon slices (About 3 or 4 round slices) 600 ml water off the boil 100 ml red rum, dark rum or brandy (Optional)

## Method

Take the ginger, the size of a golf ball is 30 g and this will make a good strong tea especially if infused for a long time. Slice it into fine strips, and cut these into batons.

Warm the flask and add all ingredients in order: ginger, lemon, maple syrup, spirits (Optional), top up with water and seal. Give a gentle shake to mix.

Wait at least 30 minutes for the ginger to infuse, strain and enjoy.

## Variations

While you can't easily add powdered spices, you can try whole cloves or a small piece of a cinnamon stick. I personally prefer just the ginger as it allows the full flavour of that wonderful root to come through.
