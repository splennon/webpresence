The recipe makes about 30 small squares of delicious imitation fudge, and is very quick and easy to make.

400 g Ground Almonds 70 g Unsweetened Dessicated Coconut 430 g Hazelnut Butter 200 g Cocoa Liquor Buttons, chopped 100 g Whey of appropriate flavour (Not fruity) 200 g Organic Raw Cold Pressed Coconut Oil 1 teaspoon Cinnamon 1 teaspoon Sea Salt 100 ml Strong Espresso/Ristretto 20 g Splenda or equivalent sweetener (Or 1 g pure sucralose)

In a pan melt the coconut oil and cocoa liquor buttons.

Combine the ground almonds, coconut, nut butter, whey, cinnamon, salt, splenda and coffee in a large bowl and stir/knead until well distributed. (Latex gloves help a lot if you want to use your hands as the mixture won't stick.)

Pour the melted coconut oil and cacao over the mixture and mix well using a large spoon. Alternatively an egg beater on a low setting works well.

Take a flat tin with square corners about 30x20 cm and line with greaseproof paper if required. Press the mixture into the tin and even it out.

Take a foodsafe scraper and draw lines to divide into 8x4 rectangles, then use the scraper to push through the mixture and cut out the rectangles. Do this before chilling the mixture or it will then be too brittle.

Chill in the fridge for an hour, and then repeat the cutting with the scraper, and return to the fridge.

After some hours, when hard, break the squares apart and enjoy low carbohydrate, delicious bombs of healthy fat to fuel your keto diet.
