This delicious relish has lots of apple and a medium-sweet flavour and a warm aroma of cloves. Serve it on fried bread, full Irish breakfast, over hash browns and fried eggs, on burgers with cheese and bacon, on toast with home cooked ham or with a cheeseboard and oat crackers. This recipe makes about 2 kilogrammes so you won't be stuck for relish for some time. If you follow the pasteurisation step it will keep, frozen for a year or in the fridge for a few months until opened.

2.2 kg ripe tomatoes, cored and chopped 1 large onions, chopped (330 g) 1 large sweet pepper, (130g) 1.5 tablespoon salt 5 Granny Smith apples (140 g each) 250 g raisins 2 tablespoon curry powder 2 tablespoon mustard powder or english mustard 0.5 tsp chilli flakes (optional) 1 teaspoon cloves 1 teaspoon allspice 1 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 250 ml white wine or apple cider vinegar 180 g brown sugar

To thicken: 2 tablespoons arrowroot (tapioca starch) or cornflour 2 tablespoons cold water

The sweet pepper will leave tiny strips of skin behind in the finished relish, these are not problematic, but you may prefer to char and peel the pepper.

Coarsely dice the tomatoes, and finely dice the onion and pepper and mix with the salt. Put the mixture in a metal sieve over a bowl and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. A surprising amount of water will drain out of the chopped mixture and can be discarded. When no more water appears in the bowl proceed with the method. If you are concerned with the amount of salt in the recipe understand that much of it ends up in the water that drains from the chopped mixture and is discarded.

Place all ingredients except arrowroot/cornflour and water into a pan and bring to the boil. Simmer with the lid off for 90 minutes, stirring occasionally. Be careful not to boil vigorously as it may burn to the bottom of the pan leaving black flecks. Once there is little fluid left, replace the lid to prevent overdrying so cooking may continue. Mix the arrowroot or cornflour with water and add to the relish while simmering. If using arrowroot, which is best, remove from the heat and stir vigorously for two minutes. If using cornstarch keep the pot on the heat and stir for two minutes.

You may use the product once cool, but if you wish to extend shelf life to 3 months (1 year frozen) then, while still hot, place in a sous vide bag and pasteurise at 83 celsius for 30 minutes. Refrigerate or freeze thereafter.
