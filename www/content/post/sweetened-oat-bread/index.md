This sweet oat bread combines coconut, almonds, raisins and apple in a delicious light oat based brack ideal for serving with tea as a healthy alternative to cakes and biscuits, and it's fully made within an hour. You can also double the quantity and use a large round tin for more people.

## Ingredients

500 g greek yoghurt (Full or low fat are good) 150 g coconut flour 100 g ground almonds 200 g porridge oats 50 g raisins 50 g diced apple (About half a small apple) 50 g brown sugar (Optional) 1 teaspoon baking powder 50 ml water

# Method

Mix all ingredients. The dough will be stiff but you don't need to knead it like wheat bread. Form a rough ball shape with your hands and press into a lightly oiled nonstick baking tin.

Bake at 175 celcius for 50 minutes.

Turn out and cool, and it's ready for use, however, if you refrigerate it overnight you can run it through a bread slicer in the morning for sliced bread.
