This spicy relish has a real kick of jalapeños, and you can adjust the quantity to your taste. It's perfect for burgers where the robust flavour of beef balances the heat of the relish, or for those who like spicy food, serve with breakfast, hash browns, fingers of fried bread, or strong cheese. This recipe makes about 800 grammes of relish.

1 kg ripe tomatoes 1 large onions (330 g) 1 large sweet pepper (130g) 0.5 tablespoon salt 1 Granny Smith apple (140 g) 150 g raisins 50 g jalapeños 0.5 tablespoon curry powder 0.5 tablespoon mustard powder 0.5 teaspoon chilli flakes (optional) 0.5 teaspoon cloves 0.5 teaspoon allspice 0.5 teaspoon cumin 120 ml apple cider vinegar 100 g brown sugar

To thicken: 1 tablespoon arrowroot (Tapioca starch) or cornflour 1 tablespoon cold water

Optionally you can char and peel the sweet pepper to remove the skin as this won't cook away, it is okay to leave it in though.

Coarsely dice the tomatoes and finely dice the onion and pepper and mix with the salt. Put the mixture in a metal sieve over a bowl and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. A surprising amount of water will drain out of the chopped mixture and can be discarded. When no more water appears in the bowl proceed with the method. If you are concerned with the amount of salt in the recipe understand that much of it ends up in the water that drains from the chopped mixture and is discarded.

Place all ingredients except arrowroot/cornflour and water into a pan and bring to the boil. Simmer with the lid off for 90 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once there is little fluid left, replace the lid to prevent burning so cooking may continue. Mix the arrowroot or cornflour with water and add to the relish while simmering. If using arrowroot, which is best, remove from the heat and stir vigorously for two minutes. If using cornstarch keep the pot on the heat and stir for two minutes.

You may use the product once cool, but if you wish to extend shelf life to 3 months (1 year frozen) then, while still hot, place in a sous vide bag and pasteurise at 83 celsius for 30 minutes. Refrigerate or freeze thereafter.
