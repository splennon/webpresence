A delicious plain ketchup bursting with tomato flavour and no hidden ingredients.

400g tinned chopped tomatoes 200g tube of tomato purée 50g raisins 1 teaspoon sea salt 100 g White Wine Vinegar 1 teaspoon Garlic Powder 1 teaspoon Onion powder 2 teaspoon English Mustard 1 tablespoon of brown sugar 1 teaspoon medium curry powder 1 teaspoon Smoked Paprika 0.25 teaspoon ground cloves 0.5 teaspoon Chilli Flakes Pinch or to taste Cumin, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Cayenne, Allspice, Pepper

Add all ingredients to a heavy pan and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes or until approximately the thickness of mass produced ketchup. The ketchup will thicken a little more when cooled.

Purée with a stick blender until the raisins are no longer visible and to the desired consistency.

You may use the product once cool, but if you wish to extend shelf life to 3 months (1 year frozen) then, while still hot, place in a sous vide bag and pasteurise at 83 celsius for 30 minutes. Refrigerate or freeze unopened thereafter.
