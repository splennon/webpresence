These delicious cookies substitute some sucralose to reduce the sugar, you could possibly even reduce it further. You can select 100 to 200 g of mixins, like peanuts, cashews, chopped candied peel, raisins, dried fruit, chocolate chips, there will be sufficient batter to bind this quantity.

75 g Butter  
75 g Coconut Oil  
40 g Demerara Sugar  
0.5 g Sucralose or equivalent sweetener  
75 g Plain White Flour  
150 g Oat Flour (You can make this from rolled oats in a food processor if required)  
2 Medium Eggs  
Half Level Teaspoon Baking Powder  
2 tsp Vanilla Essence (Optional)  
50 g whole rolled oats (Optional)  
100 to 200 g any suitable mixture of nuts, dried fruits or other mixins

If using hard dried fruit like raisins it is best to soak them in a small quantity of water in the fridge for an hour or two. Dried mango softened in this way is delicious with peanuts and cashews. Don't use too much water to soak the fruit though as you may wash away the flavour. Drain before use.

The recipe specifies 75g butter and 75g coconut oil, and this is a good blend to produce soft crumbly cookies. If you change the ratio to 100g butter and 50g coconut oil you will get a shorter cookie (In the direction of shortbread.) If doing this you should avoid or reduce mixins that will fall out of the cookie when broken, peanuts, being round, are a big offender, but chocolate chips and raisins should be fine.

If using salted nuts in your mixins results can be delicious but you may need to shake or even rinse the salt off if there is a lot. I often leave salted peanuts unwashed if the salt quantity is modest.

Soften the butter and coconut oil, if necessary in a microwave on a low setting, watching carefully. The butter should be soft but still opaque, too hot and you may cook the eggs.

Add sugar, eggs and vanilla essence to a small bowl and beat it with an electric egg beater for a minute.

In a large dry bowl sift the dry ingredients: oat flour, plain flour, baking powder, sucralose, and mix in the sugar and butter mix. Combine with an egg beater or metal spoon until evenly distributed, a minute should suffice.

When combined, add the mixins and stir in to distribute. The batter is now ready.

Take two baking sheets, teflon works well. Place a plate on your digital scales and place a desert or soup spoon on and tare. Pick up 50 g of batter and weigh it on the plate, complete with spoon. 50 g of cookie batter will make 14 medium sized cookies.

Once each cookie is weighed at 50 g take it off into your hands and briskly roll into a ball without much pressure. Place the ball on the teflon or baking sheet until you have used all the batter.

Take a fork, dip in water and shake. Press down each ball into even sized cookies using the fork and your fingers to maintain a roughly round shape.

When you have evenly sized disks place in a preheated fan oven at 190 degrees celsius.

While the cookies bake, check them after 7 minutes and every few minutes thereafter. If the edges or rear of your baking sheet are browning too quickly you should rotate them around the sheet to get an even browning.

Once the cookies are a light to medium brown, at your preference, allow them to cool on their sheets or a wire rack. If you go from light to medium brown your cookie will be drier and more crumbly. Once cool wrap in a clean tea towel or a plastic bag, but do not seal the bag.

Place the cookies to rest in the fridge overnight to develop the best flavour and texture.
