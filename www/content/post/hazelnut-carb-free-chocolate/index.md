Place your coconut oil in the oven at a low temperature, about 60 degrees for ten minutes or so to melt if desired.

In a large metal bowl add the Cocoa Liquor Buttons, Coconut Oil and Hazelnut Butter and return to the oven at a low temperature of about 60 degrees until melted. Use a low temperature to avoid destroying nutrients.

When melted blend together with an electric egg beater or a suitable implement.
