650 ml milk  
225 g sushi or pudding rice  
To flavour choose some of:  
Nutmeg,  
Cloves,  
Cinnamon,  
Cardamom,  
Almond essence,  
Vanilla essence,  
Sushi ginger (2-4 slices),  
Sucralose or sugar.

First heat all ingredients and stir well to break up the rice. You can do this in a rice cooker set to hot but you must be extremely careful to turn it to the warm setting when hot or it will boil over creating a mess.

Leave in the rice cooker on the warm setting for two to three hours, stirring occasionally.

Chill if desired and eat with jam, fruit or wobble cake.
