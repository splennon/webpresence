This soap is made with 52% Virgin Olive Oil, but cannot truly be called a Castile as it also contains Coconut Oil which is a staple of soapmaking. Coconut Oil makes a soap that is hard, cleansing and bubbly whereas the generous measure of Olive Oil lends the necessary creamy and conditioning properties that, in balance, produce a cleansing soap that is mild on the skin.

A light fragrance of Sweet Orange and Sandalwood completes the recipe.

All natural soap is made with oils mixed with Sodium Hydroxide (Lye) dissolved in water. The lye reacts with the fats and if the proportions are correct (Which of course they are) all the lye reacts with the fat and turns into soap. Careful measuring and a judicious application of Science produces a fully reacted soap with just a small amount (3% or so) of extra oil left over to moisturise the skin, and no remaining Sodium Hydroxide, having been consumed in the saponification reaction.

Unlike commercially produced soap, Cold Process Soap is allowed to react without the addition of extra heat and contains all the natural glycerine byproduct of the saponification reaction which in a factory would be removed for use in other cosmetics.

Archeologists excavating ancient Babylon discovered soap in clay jars dating back 4,800 years and ancient civilisations are known to have used other alkaline substances such as ashes instead of Sodium Hydroxide.

Fully reacted soap is a harmless substance and animals are known to eat it sometimes, not sharing our refined sensibilities. The experienced soapmaker knows that, once a soap has fully reacted and shows no signs of being highly alkaline anymore it should be tasted (Though not eaten) to ensure there is no 'zap' of lye left which feels like touching a 9 volt battery to the tongue. One sample per batch is sufficient though, so should you have received this soap it will not have been extensively licked.

Storage This soap will keep for at least a year, and though it will change aesthetically is still good to use, it doesn't perish like food or any of its ingredients, and will improve for many months. Store at room temperature away from finished and decorative surfaces as ageing soap may release some glycerin.

Usage Lather in the hands and apply to the skin. Rinse thoroughly. This soap is not formulated for washing hair.

When finished leave the soap in a place where it can drain as a puddle of water will dissolve it.
