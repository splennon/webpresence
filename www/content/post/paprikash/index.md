A delicious dish of chicken and paprika.

1Â  kg chicken breast approximately 2 medium onions 1 red bell pepper 400g tin chopped tomatoes 500g passata 1 bulb garlic 3 tablespoons paprika 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper or crushed dried chillies (Optional) 1 chicken stock cube dissolved in 100 ml water 50 ml white wine vinegar / rice wine vinegar / apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon yeast extract or equivalent flavour enhancer as source of glutamate (Optional) 3 tablespoons of sour cream or plain greek yoghurt (Optional but recommended)

Cut the chicken into strips. Dice onion and red pepper medium fine. Add all ingredients except yoghurt/cream to a slow cooker of 3.5 litre or greater capacity. Add the passata last as you can stop at 400g in preference to overfilling the slow cooker.

Stir to mix then cover with lid. Heat on high for about 3 hours until bubbles rise at the sides or temperature exceeds 75 degrees Celsius. Cook further on medium for 4 hours or low for 6 hours or until the chicken is tender.

Mix in (Or serve with) sour cream or yoghurt. Typically this dish is served on pasta, egg noodle or spaetzle.
