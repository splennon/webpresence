# Hair Care for Old Dudes

One day I got tired using Minoxidol. As I'd gotten to 44 without losing my hair I thought i might not be significantly at risk anymore and I wanted to try a natural approach instead.

There is no medical advice in this article just my own experience. I made this oil mixture, and a few vriations of it and found that it worked really well to thicken my hair and to claw back some of the receeding hairline at the front which only copious amounts of minoxidol ever did before. Personally I prefer this way.

Make the base oil first using the quantities provided then add another quarter volume of essential oils by the recipe below.

## Base Oils

Make up a base oil mixture by stirring together the following base oils. Do not shake or aggitate as this will introduce air.

Cocont Oil
: - use at 2 parts
  - to moisturise without softening hair too much
  - warm gently to melt if required

Castor Oil
: - use at 2 parts
  - to nourish

Olive Oil
: - optional
  - use at 1 to 2 parts
  - to block DHT production in the scalp

Neem Oil
: - optional
  - use at 1 part
  - to strenghten the hair

## Important Essential Oils

For every 4 parts of base oil you have made add a total of 1 part essential oils. Use every oil on the important list unless you specifically object to one, then consider the benifits of the oils from the optional list. In total the essential oils should make up approximately 20% of the finished product.

Peppermint
: - stimulates the follicle
  - clean refreshing scent

Rosemary
: - improves circulation

Basil
: - nourishes hair

Lavender
: - antibacterial
  - blocks DHT
  - helps to round out scent

## Optional Essential Oils

The following active ingredients may be benificial depending on your particular case, use them sparingly.

Cassia or Cinnamon Essential Oil
: - provides extra warming
  - increases blood flow significantly

Tea Tree Oil
: - extra antibacterial properties

Capsucum Extract
: - use in tiny quantities
  - extra warming and blood flow

## Optional Ingredients for Scent

You can optionally add small quantities of oils to round out or modify the scent. This is purely optional, you can skip this for a first attempt. I personally like Citradora, Lime and Bergamot. Don't use anything too pungent as you'll have to spend a lot of time smelling this.
